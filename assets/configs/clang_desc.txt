The Clang project provides a language front-end and tooling infrastructure for languages in the C language family (C, C++, Objective C/C++, OpenCL, CUDA, and RenderScript) for the LLVM project. Both a GCC-compatible compiler driver (clang) and an MSVC-compatible compiler driver (clang-cl.exe) are provided.

[] Features and Goals
Some of the goals for the project include the following:

>> End-User Features:

     Fast compiles and low memory use
     Expressive diagnostics (examples)
     GCC & MSVC compatibility

>> Utility and Applications:

     Modular library based architecture
     Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation, etc.)
     Allow tight integration with IDEs
     Use the LLVM 'Apache 2' License

>> Internal Design and Implementation:

     A real-world, production quality compiler
     A simple and hackable code base
     A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++
     Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants
